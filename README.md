# Image-Captioning-using-TensorFlow
This repository builds an image caption generator using deep learning. It extracts image features with InceptionV3/DenseNet201 and generates captions with LSTM/GRU networks. Trained on the Flickr8k dataset, it automatically creates descriptive captions for images, enabling applications like image understanding and accessibility.
